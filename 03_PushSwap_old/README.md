## How it work?

First of all, you've a file named `tester_data` which contained all the datas tests. In the file, each line corresponds to a test, and the last number of the line corresponds to the maximum number of operations you allow your program to perform. If this number is negative, its mean that you don't have any maximum number, so it'll take the value to have 100%.
