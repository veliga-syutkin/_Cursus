			so_long release notes:
v1
MLX compiles successfully

v2
My 1st open window (with compiling MLX with the project)

v3
Added ESC management. Added valgrind rule to makefile; need to ask if leaks are expected or not.

v4
WIP memory leak checks

v5
Changed 256 into HEIGHT/WIDTH macros; updated mlx_loop what key was pressed instead of width & height

v6
Proper closing windows on ESC press & release

v7
added valid maps for tests

v8
expanded so_long.h for 4-chained list as map + defined WALL EXIT FLOOR PLAYER COLLECTIBLE

v9
Creating map handler

v10
To fix: LIBFT t_stack description; load_map for proper chained list initialize; t_stack and t_map from main to pass all along the program.

v11
WIP memory_handler, map handler.

v12
WIP

v13
WIP on compilation bugs (there is a lot of them). Done Map handler, need test it. Updated Memory_handler.

v14
Compilation bugs resolved.

v15
Fixed various SIGSEGV, need to fix map's cells linkings. [...]

v16
Solved segfaults (all pointers in map struct HAS to be initialized!)

v17
WIP map checker. Map loader works fine.

v18
Made parsing, works very fine, almost perfectly.

v19
Small reorganization.

v20
added another unvalid map

v21
Developed algorithm. Yet to be implemented. Started to look for textures...

v22
Implemented cross press in window bar handling

v23
Added full key support (arrows, WASD and ZQSD). Made few progress with norminette. Started implementing player events. Troubles: IOT when pressing esc. WTF?!

v24
passing wrong arg to function close_window when escape (compare with mlx_close hook on X !)

v25
Fixed ESC IOT crash

v26
Small fixes

v27
Implemented win condition.

v28
Added turn counter, added last direction player memory, fixed message loops, and few other very minnor things.

Graphics + comments + small fixes, updates...

v31
Updated flag warning (unitialized value when if is false)

v32
Changed width and height of window to match valid1.ber. Turned in turn counter in terminal. Deleted moving keys' log. To do: texture for collectible and exit, debug collectible may be staying displayed after it's gone (prayge). Memory leaks are due to mlx, checked all valgrind logs (with both --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all) manually.

v33
Fixed aalferov's breach: undefined behaviour when inner content is other than 1 E C P 0

v34
Fixed empty line (aalferov's breach) bug (either empty line bypass map checker or map checker refuses valid maps).

v35
WIP collectible display

v36
OBT live. Final line before finish.

v37
Limited map's size (to not overcome 1920*1024 screen). Added return check from mlx_key_hook.
