Suggestion from copilot:
	1. Read the map from the file
	2. Check if the map is valid
	3. Create a window
	4. Load images
	5. Draw the map
	6. Handle the events
	7. Close the window

	The game is about GULAG.
The player is a guard.
	The player has to catch all escaping prisoners. 
Prisoners == collectible. 
	THEY CAN MOVE.
	If the player catches hiding prisoner, the player dies. 
	If the player catches running away prisoner, the prisoner is caught (as collectible)
	The prisoner can hide only if they are fed.

	Cells of the prisoners provide them unlimited food and hide ability.
	Player moves at least 2 times faster than prisoner (due to lack of quality food of prisoner).
